        <h2> Louisville Facts </h2>
        <p class="p1">
            Louisville (pronounced Listeni/ˈluːəvəl/, Listeni/ˈlʌvəl/ or Listeni/ˈluːiːvɪl/) is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the 30th-most populous city in the United States.
             It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated as first-class, the other being the state's second-largest city of Lexington.
             Louisville is the historical seat and, since 2003, the nominal seat of Jefferson County. 
            The rapids at the Falls of the Ohio created a barrier to river travel, and as a result, settlements grew up at this stopping point. 
            The first European settlement in the vicinity of modern-day Louisville was on Corn Island in 1778 by Col. George Rogers Clark, credited as the founder of Louisville.
             Several landmarks in the community are named after him. Two years later, in 1780, the Virginia General Assembly approved the town charter of Louisville.
             The city was named in honor of King Louis XVI of France, whose soldiers were then aiding Americans in the Revolutionary War. 
            Early residents lived in forts to protect themselves from Indian raids, but moved out by the late 1780s. In 1803, 
            explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark organized their expedition across America in the town of Clarksville, 
            Indiana at the present-day Falls of the Ohio opposite Louisville, Kentucky.
        </p>

        <p class="p2">
            The downtown business district of Louisville is located immediately south of the Ohio River and southeast of the Falls of the Ohio. 
            Major roads extend outwards from the downtown area in all directions, like the spokes of a wheel. 
            The airport is about 6.75 miles (10.86 km) south of the downtown area.
             The industrial sections of town are to the south and west of the airport, while most of the residential areas of the city are to the southwest, south, and east of downtown. 
            In 2010, the 22,000-seat KFC Yum! Center was completed.
             Twelve of the 15 buildings in Kentucky over 300 feet (91 m) are located in downtown Louisville.
             Another primary business and industrial district is located in the suburban area east of the city on Hurstbourne Parkway.
        </p>

        <p class="p3">
        Louisville today is home to dozens of companies and organizations across several industrial classifications. 
        However, the underpinning of the city's economy since its earliest days has been the shipping and cargo industries.
         Its strategic location at the Falls of the Ohio, and its unique position in the central United States (within one day's road travel to 60% of the cities in the continental U.S.)
         make it a practical location for the transfer of cargo along its route to other destinations.  
        The Louisville and Portland Canal and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad were important links in water and rail transportation

        <p class="p1">
            The Kentucky Center, dedicated in 1983, located in the downtown hotel and entertainment district, features a variety of plays and concerts. 
            This is also the home of the Louisville Ballet, Louisville Orchestra, Bourbon Baroque, StageOne Family Theatre, 
            Kentucky Shakespeare Festival, which operates the oldest professional outdoor Shakespeare festival, and the Kentucky Opera, 
            which is the twelfth oldest opera in the United States.

            College sports are popular in the Louisville area.
             The Louisville Cardinals have competed as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), since joining that league in July 2014.
             College basketball is particularly popular. 
            The Louisville Cardinals’ Freedom Hall averaged sellouts for 10 straight years and the downtown KFC Yum! Center following suit with regular sellouts.
             The Cardinals ranked third nationally in attendance in 2012–13, the most recent of the program's three national championship seasons.
             The Cardinals also hold the Big East conference women's basketball paid attendance record with nearly 17,000 attending the game against the Kentucky Wildcats in 2008. 
            The Louisville market has ranked first in ratings for the NCAA men's basketball tournament every year since 1999. 
            The Kentucky Wildcats used to play an annual game in Freedom Hall.

        <p class="p3">
            In a 2005 survey, Morgan Quitno Press ranked Louisville as the seventh safest large city in the United States. 
            The 2006 edition of the survey ranked Louisville eighth. 
            In 2004, Louisville recorded 70 murders. The numbers for 2005 ranged from 55 to 59 (FBI says 55, LMPD says 59), which was down 16 percent from 2004. 
            In 2006, Louisville-Jefferson County recorded 50 murders, which was significantly lower than previous years. 
            In 2008, Louisville recorded 79 murders. The Louisville Metro Area's overall violent crime rate was 412.6 per 100,000 residents in 2005. 
            The Elizabethtown, Kentucky Metro Area, which is part of Louisville's Combined Statistical Area, was the 17th safest Metro in the U.S. Kentucky has the 5th lowest violent crime rate out of the 50 states.
             Violent crime is most concentrated west of downtown, especially in the Russell neighborhood.
             The West End, located north of Algonquin Parkway and West of 9th Street, had 32 of the city's 79 murders in 2007.
